100 days until my baby's due-date; 100 days to learn how to code :)

Inspired by awalsh3, I've decided to properly commit to giving coding a crack. We are a small team at Any One Thing and my remit as Artistic Director of the company has been, to date, to focus on the theatre side of things (I'm a theatre director by day). We discovered on a team call yesterday that my second son is due in exactly 100 days time, so it seems like an ideal (or slightly bonkers?) time to start something I've been meaning to do in over a year now: learn how to code. My first son was born exactly on his due date which is pretty rare. Let's see if I manage to learn the basics before Number 2 arrives.

Here we go... Baby steps...!
